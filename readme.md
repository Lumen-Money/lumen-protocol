# Lumen: Lending & Borrowing Protocol

Welcome to **Lumen**, a revolutionary lending and borrowing protocol built on the robust foundation of Compound V2 and strategically deployed on NeonEVM to leverage the unparalleled efficiency of the Solana blockchain. Lumen is designed to offer an optimized decentralized finance (DeFi) experience, combining the proven mechanisms of Compound with the high throughput and low transaction costs of Solana through NeonEVM.

## Features

### Based on Compound V2:

- **Liquidity Pool-Based Lending**: Users can supply assets to liquidity pools and earn interest or borrow against their collateral at stable and variable interest rates.
central oversight.
- **luToken Mechanism**: Like Compound, Lumen utilizes cTokens to represent a user's stake in the liquidity pool, enabling users to earn interest or borrow against their holdings.
- **Transparent and Automated**: Interest rates are determined algorithmically based on supply and demand, ensuring fairness and efficiency in borrowing costs and lending yields.
- **Governance Token** _comming soon_: Lumen incorporates a governance token, allowing token holders to propose, debate, and implement changes to the protocol.

### Benefits of Deployment on NeonEVM:

- **High Throughput**: By leveraging NeonEVM on Solana, Lumen benefits from Solana's high transaction throughput, drastically reducing transaction processing times.
- **Low Transaction Costs**: The efficiency of Solana's blockchain significantly lowers the cost of transactions, making lending and borrowing more accessible and cost-effective for a wider audience.
- **Ethereum Compatibility**: NeonEVM allows Ethereum developers and users to interact with Lumen using familiar tools and wallets, bridging the gap between the Ethereum and Solana ecosystems.
- **Scalability**: With Solana's scalability, Lumen can support a growing number of users and transactions without compromising on speed or cost, ensuring a seamless DeFi experience.
- **Cross-Chain Opportunities**: Deployment on NeonEVM opens up novel possibilities for cross-chain interactions, enabling users to take advantage of the unique features and assets across both the Ethereum and Solana ecosystems.

### Points Program

- **Earn Points for Deposits**: Lumen introduces a Points program, where users earn points based on the amount and duration of their deposits in the liquidity pools.
- **Ranking System**: Users' points contribute to their ranking within the Lumen ecosystem, unlocking various benefits and rewards.
- **Chain Airdrops**: High-ranking users will be eligible for exclusive airdrops, including new tokens and access to premium features within the Lumen protocol and partner projects.
- **Engagement and Loyalty Rewards**: The Points program is designed to reward engagement and loyalty, providing an additional layer of value for our users' contributions to the protocol's liquidity and stability.

## Getting Started

To start using Lumen, follow these steps:

1. **Connect Your Wallet**: Lumen supports several wallets compatible with Ethereum and Solana. Connect your preferred wallet to interact with the protocol.
2. **Supply Assets**: Deposit your assets into Lumen's liquidity pools to start earning interest and points immediately.
3. **Borrow Assets**: Use your supplied assets as collateral to borrow from the liquidity pools at competitive interest rates.
4. **Manage Your Portfolio**: Monitor your supplied and borrowed assets through the Lumen dashboard to optimize your DeFi strategies and view your Points balance and ranking.

## Governance

Lumen is governed by its community of token holders. If you hold governance tokens, you can participate in the proposal and voting process to help shape the future of the protocol. We encourage active participation to ensure Lumen evolves in alignment with its users' needs.
